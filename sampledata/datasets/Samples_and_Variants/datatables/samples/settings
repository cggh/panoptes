NameSingle: sample    # Display name referring to a table item (single, no capital)
NamePlural: samples    # Display name referring to a table item (plural, no capital)
Description: A table containing a number of samples     # A description of this dataset

# The primary key column ID for this table. This should correspond to a column in data containing a unique value for each record
# Optionally, this parameter can be set to 'AutoKey' to instruct the software to automatically generate a primary key
PrimKey: ID

# Optionally, "FetchRecordCount: false" can be used to instruct Panoptes *not* to try to fetch total record counts in data table views. This can be used to speed up the software in case of large datasets (e.g. ﱅ6 records)

# The following list of properties will be used by some tools that allow the user to quickly find a (set of) item(s)
QuickFindFields: ID,SiteID,SampleTypeID


# The following lists all the columns in the data files, and tells Panoptes how to interpret them as properties of the data items
# NOTE: Optionally, "AutoScanProperties=true" can be used to instruct Panoptes to automatically import all datatable columns
# Both mechanisms can be combined: further settings can still be specified for individual properties
Properties:

# The following block declares that this datatable contains a genome values for each item in the table
# Panoptes will process these using the multiresolution filterbanking, and the user can display these as tracks in the genome browser
#  There should be a subfolder with the identifier of this track in the datatable source data folder. For each data item, this folder should contain a data file with the name equal to the primary key
